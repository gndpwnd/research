**IMASS** (Intelligent Multi-Agent Swarm System) is a full-stack research project focused on developing a cyber-resilient, AI-driven localization system for land-based rovers operating in GPS-denied environments. This proof-of-concept integrates modern AI techniques, autonomous drone swarm behaviors, and real-time localization strategies.

The system leverages drone-based agents to deliver GPS-corrected positioning data to a ground rover, enabling accurate navigation without reliance on direct satellite signals.

## Key Contributions

- **AI-Driven Localization**  
  Integrated large language model (LLM)-enhanced algorithms to assist with intelligent decision-making in communication and navigation protocols.

- **Precision through Physical Modeling**  
  Applied mathematical, geometric, and physical principles to synchronize radio-based communication with positioning calculations.

- **Efficient Algorithms**  
  Designed and implemented algorithms that optimize computational efficiency, reducing the need for high-cost hardware.

- **Cost vs. Accuracy Trade-Offs**  
  Conducted system-level analyses to evaluate the balance between hardware expense and localization precision.

- **Error Analysis in 2D and 3D**  
  Investigated localization constraints and sources of error, including:
  - Time of Flight (ToF) distance estimation  
  - Multilateration methods  
  - Target occlusion and signal interference

- **Swarm Coordination**  
  Collaborated across disciplines to develop swarm behaviors that adaptively reposition drones for optimal rover localization accuracy.

IMASS represents a step toward resilient, intelligent autonomous systems capable of navigating complex and constrained environments through interdisciplinary innovation.
