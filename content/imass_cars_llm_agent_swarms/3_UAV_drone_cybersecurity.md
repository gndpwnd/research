Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, are increasingly integrated into various applications, from military and surveillance to commercial delivery and disaster management. This widespread use, however, exposes them to significant cybersecurity and general security concerns, including cyber, physical, and hybrid attacks. The growing popularity of drones is accompanied by security issues due to the unregulated connection between drones and ground control stations.

### I. General Security Concerns for Drones and UAVs

UAVs face a multitude of security and privacy challenges due to their intricate nature and the integration of robotics and embedded systems into society.

- **Cyber Threats:** These include aviation control, navigation systems, ATMs, wireless communication devices, hacking, spoofing, jamming, and communication interception.
- **Physical Threats:** These encompass kinetic attacks, theft, and reverse engineering, which can damage UAVs or lead to the theft of sensitive data and technology.
- **Hybrid Threats:** These combine elements of both cyber and physical attacks.
- **Privacy Concerns:** Unauthorized surveillance and data breaches are significant privacy issues, with sensitive information potentially exposed through intercepted data. Drones with high-resolution cameras can capture detailed images, raising apprehensions about surveillance and data misuse.
- **Insider Threats:** Internal actors, whether intentionally or unintentionally, can compromise UAV operations or disclose confidential information.
- **Environmental Threats:** Adverse weather and challenging geographical terrain can affect UAV performance and security.
- **Public Safety:** Drones can pose threats to essential infrastructures like government buildings, energy facilities, transportation networks, and communication systems if weaponized. The increasing presence of drones in airspace heightens the risk of mid-air collisions with manned aircraft.
- **Regulatory and Ethical Issues:** The absence of standardized security procedures, inadequate operator training, and the need for compliance with regulations are persistent challenges. Ethical concerns include autonomy, transparency, and accountability.
- **Limited Resources:** UAVs often have limited computing resources, memory, battery life, and processing power, which constrains the implementation of robust security measures. This can also affect flight time and storage capacity.
