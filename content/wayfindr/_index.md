This project focuses on the development of an open source robot that acts as a tour guide for visitors to a building. The robot uses a camera and LIDAR to navigate through the building, avoiding obstacles and people. The robot is also equipped with an android tablet for users to communicate with an LLM to ask questions about the building and determine where they would like to go. The robot will then guide the user to their destination using localization and pathfinding algorithms. The goal is to create a low cost robot that can be used in a variety of settings, such as museums, hospitals, and office buildings.
