This project focuses on the development of a full-stack proof of concept that integrates cutting-edge AI research, autonomous swarm coordination, and real-time localization techniques to support a land-based rover operating in GPS-denied environments. The system utilizes drone-based agents to deliver precise positional corrections based on known GPS coordinates, enabling robust and resilient navigation.

## Key Contributions

- **Physics-Based Communication Modeling**  
  Applied mathematical, geometric, and physical principles to merge radio communication techniques with accurate position estimation.

- **Algorithm Design and Optimization**  
  Created and implemented efficient algorithms that reduce computational load and minimize hardware dependency.

- **Hardware vs. Accuracy Evaluation**  
  Conducted detailed analyses of system performance trade-offs between cost-effective hardware and localization accuracy.

- **Error Source Investigation**  
  Explored and modeled key sources of positioning error in 2D and 3D environments, including:
  - Time of Flight (ToF) distance measurement  
  - Multilateration-based positioning  
  - Occlusion and line-of-sight limitations

- **Swarm-Based Optimization**  
  Worked within a multi-disciplinary team to develop dynamic drone swarm behaviors that enhance rover localization by adaptively repositioning based on real-time data.

This project bridges AI, robotics, and communication theory to deliver a resilient localization system capable of navigating challenging, signal-denied terrains.
