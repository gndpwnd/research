IMASS with LLM-Enhanced Design - GPS-Denied Rover Application



1) come up with survey paper for LLM in swarm model
2) original topic was graph theory in cybersecurity
- use graph theory to describe the multi-unit mission
- when it is time to write report, be able to tie it closely to the graph security problem

3) distributed control vs centralizd control (base station)
 - don't want a base station to control the entire swarm of drones
 - you might have a base station talking to some drones but not really
 - want drones to give information to other drones for updates so not having to go through a middle man
 - hard to achieve efficient data communication like how to transmit data quickly through entire network
  - pathfinding algorithms?
   - need a way to measure speed/difficulty of signal transfer
  - not really a mother/parent drone

4) how to move the drones
 - pathfinding algorithms

5) have an llm agent per vehicle?


6) need to convert numerical data into language
 - data analysis, convert into a series of equations?
 - convert equations into sentences?
 - convert sentences into paragraphs


7) how to balance between vehicle algorithms and LLM control?
 - complexity of data in environment
 - simulations only get better if you have LLMs in control
 - how can you make the LLMs better for the vehicle simulations

8) cyber stuff - keep track of problems and variables for mitigarion and analysis
- GPS security
- agent-agent communication
- agent-LLM communication
- user-LLM communication

immediate next step

- work on getting LLM to control agents
- want to express problem and anomalies using graph theory
- use graph theory to facilitate analysis and reaction to cybersecurity problem


- need to research existing papers
- plenty of work to make paper on survey of multi-agent systm
- focus on cybersecurity aspect - dealing with GPS signal loss, jamming
- lots of people already done work on multi-agent system controlled by LLM
  - want to focus on unexpected communication stuff

- study the problem of cybersecurity caused by these jamming things

- obstacle is related to communication uncertainty

- we want to do survey on multi agent system, but focus on communication uncertainty and cybersecurity - how can lLm facilitate addressing those problems
