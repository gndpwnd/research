## Open Source AI Models and APIs Used



### Text (Planning, Topics, Scripts)



Use local large-language models (LLMs) to break down a theme into topics/subtopics and draft scripts. Modern open LLMs include Meta‚Äôs LLaMA 3 (8B, 70B parameters) and Mistral 7B (Apache-2.0 license), Google‚Äôs Gemma (2B, 7B), and others
medium.com
. These can run via frameworks like llama.cpp or Hugging Face Transformers. For example, a quantized 7B model runs in ~8‚Äì12‚ÄØGB RAM
medium.com
. Larger models (30‚Äì70B) need 40‚Äì80‚ÄØGB. If you have lecture notes or textbooks, use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): embed your documents (with e.g. FAISS/Chroma) and retrieve relevant passages to prepend to the LLM prompt. RAG ‚Äúgrounds LLMs on external knowledge‚Äù so responses use up-to-date, context-specific info
walturn.com
. In practice, tools like LangChain (with a local embedding model) can load your PDF/texts into a vector DB and fetch context for the LLM.

**Which to use?**

For structured storytelling (hook ‚Üí CTA):
LLaMA 3 70B (if you have the hardware) or Gemma 7B (lighter). These models are better at sustaining narrative arcs.

For short, punchy components (titles, hashtags, short descriptions):
Mistral 7B / Mixtral ‚Äî faster, sharp, less resource-hungry.

For best balance on a single GPU:
Gemma 7B or LLaMA 3 8B ‚Äî both can handle full scripts well and run on ~12‚Äì16 GB GPUs.


### Video Generation: Cutting-edge open models can synthesize short clips from text or images




SkyReels V1 (Skywork AI): Cinematic human-centric T2V. Generates up to 12-second videos at 24‚ÄØfps, 544√ó960 resolution
hyperstack.cloud
. Great for character animations and ads.

LTXVideo (Lightricks): Fast text-to-video (768√ó512 at 24‚ÄØfps) optimized for mid-tier GPUs. Runs on as little as 12‚ÄØGB VRAM (48‚ÄØGB recommended)
hyperstack.cloud
. Good for quick prototyping and social clips.

Mochi 1 (Genmo): 10B-param diffusion model. Produces ~5.4-second clips at 30‚ÄØfps, 640√ó480 resolution
hyperstack.cloud
. Fine-tuning requires a single NVIDIA H100/A100 (80‚ÄØGB)
hyperstack.cloud
.

HunyuanVideo (Tencent): 13B-param T2V. Up to 15 seconds at 24‚ÄØfps and 1280√ó720 (720p)
hyperstack.cloud
. Remarkably realistic; best quality uses ~80‚ÄØGB VRAM on GPUs like NVidia H100/A100
hyperstack.cloud
.

Wan 2.1 (Alibaba): 14B-param multitask model (also handles image/video/audios). Generates 12s at 720p (14B version) or 5s at 480p (1.3B ‚Äúsmall‚Äù version)
hyperstack.cloud
. Runs on ~8.2‚ÄØGB VRAM (48‚ÄØGB for large model)
hyperstack.cloud
. Multilingual and fast.

CineScale: An open extension of Wan2.1 for high-res. It enables 3K‚Äì4K outputs (e.g. 3840√ó2176) by distributing computation across many GPUs (e.g. 8√óA100)
github.com
. This shows 4K video is possible but demands heavy hardware.



**Recommendation**

üîπ Best Open Models for 1080p @ 30 fps

HunyuanVideo (Tencent)

Native 720p at 24 fps, but people upscale to 1080p easily.

Very realistic results (faces, motion, cinematic look).

With frame interpolation (RIFE, FILM, or DAIN), you can get 30 fps smoothly.

Compute: ~80 GB VRAM for best quality (H100/A100), but there are community-optimized inference pipelines for 24 GB cards (slower).

Wan 2.1 (Alibaba)

Native 720p at 12 s clips (14B model).

Upscales to 1080p cleanly using ESRGAN or Topaz AI.

More efficient: ~48 GB recommended for full res, but ‚Äúsmall‚Äù version can run on ~8‚Äì12 GB VRAM (with 480p native, then upscale).

Good for multilingual prompts + consistent style.

Mochi 1 (Genmo)

Native 640√ó480 at 30 fps, ~5.4 s clips.

Already locked to 30 fps, which makes interpolation unnecessary.

Lower res, but if you use it as base ‚Üí upscale + detail-enhancement (ControlNet / img2vid refinement), you can get strong 1080p output.

Easier to fine-tune and run compared to Hunyuan.

üîπ Strategy for 1080p 30 fps Consistency

Since you‚Äôre generating one scene at a time (3‚Äì8 s), consistency is the main challenge. Two workflows stand out:

Workflow A: Native 720p ‚Üí Upscale to 1080p

Use HunyuanVideo or Wan 2.1 to generate 720p @ 24 fps.

Apply frame interpolation (RIFE/DAIN) ‚Üí 30 fps.

Apply upscaling (ESRGAN, Topaz, StableSR) ‚Üí 1080p.
‚úÖ Pros: Most photorealistic & cinematic.
‚ùå Cons: Requires upscaling step, and interpolation can sometimes cause artifacts in fast motion.

Workflow B: Image-to-Video for Stability

First, generate a base keyframe (image) using a strong image model (Flux, Stable Diffusion XL, or Playground V2).

Animate it with AnimateDiff + ControlNet or Pika Labs (if you don‚Äôt mind closed-source).
‚úÖ Pros: Perfect for storytelling with consistent characters & art style.
‚ùå Cons: Less ‚Äúreal camera‚Äù realism; looks more like stylized animation.

üîπ My Recommendation for You

If your priority is cinematic realism:

Start with HunyuanVideo (720p@24) ‚Üí upscale to 1080p@30 with ESRGAN + RIFE.

If your priority is consistency & storytelling (e.g., same character across multiple clips):

Use AnimateDiff (image-to-video) with SDXL/Flux images as base.

Then upscale/interpolate to 1080p@30fps.


### Audio Voice (Speech)



Use open TTS models for narration. For expressive, natural voiceovers, try:

Chatterbox (Resemble AI): 0.5B Llama-based TTS (MIT license). Very easy to run and ‚Äúproduces expressive, natural speech‚Äù
modal.com
. Supports zero-shot cloning of new voices. Ideal for small GPUs (few GB VRAM).

Higgs Audio V2 (BosonAI): 5.77B params (Apache-2.0 license). Trained on 10M+ hours of speech, it yields industry-leading naturalness and emotion in generated voice
modal.com
. In benchmarks it ‚Äúwins audience scores on emulating emotion‚Äù
modal.com
. Requires more memory (~>16GB VRAM).

Other models: Orpheus (3B, multi-lingual with guided emotion and streaming output)
modal.com
, Dia (1.6B, English-only with multi-speaker and non-verbal cues)
modal.com
, Sesame CSM (1B, conversation-focused), Kokoro (82M, tiny footprint) etc. These vary in realism and size. For transcripts (with timecodes), use an open ASR like Whisper. OpenAI‚Äôs Whisper (open-source code) transcribes speech with timestamps and multi-language support
openai.com
. Whisper can align generated voice clips to text, giving accurate timestamps for video editing.


**recommendation**

üîπ Best Open-Source TTS Models for Storytelling
1. Higgs Audio V2 (BosonAI)

5.77B params ‚Äì biggest open TTS model so far.

Trained on 10M+ hours of speech, excels at emotion, pacing, and inflection.

Strong at conveying excitement, tension, or calm narration.

Recommended if you want to really deliver cinematic scripts.

Needs 16‚Äì24 GB VRAM (A100 / 4090 / cloud inference).

‚úÖ Best choice for emotional, humanlike storytelling.
‚ùå Heavy compute requirement.

2. Chatterbox (Resemble AI)

0.5B params ‚Äì lightweight and easy to run (consumer GPUs).

Great expressivity, supports zero-shot cloning (give it a few seconds of reference audio, and it can narrate in that style/voice).

Perfect if you want to create unique characters or voices for different scripts.

‚úÖ Best for variety of voices with emotion.
‚ùå Not quite as ‚Äúcinematic‚Äù as Higgs Audio V2.

3. Orpheus (3B)

Multi-lingual, supports guided emotion prompts (e.g., ‚Äúexcited,‚Äù ‚Äúserious,‚Äù ‚Äúdramatic‚Äù).

Good tradeoff between compute (needs ~12 GB VRAM) and emotional realism.

Strong choice if you want to support multiple languages in your storytelling.

4. Dia (1.6B)

English-only, but supports multi-speaker + non-verbal cues (breaths, laughs, sighs).

Excellent for dramatic storytelling since you can add subtle human touches.

Lighter than Higgs, heavier than Chatterbox.

üîπ Best Workflow for Narration

Generate script (hook ‚Üí build-up ‚Üí climax ‚Üí CTA).

Feed into emotional TTS (Higgs V2 if you want the most natural emotion, Chatterbox/Orpheus/Dia if you want lighter models).

Optionally, split script into beats/scenes so the narrator naturally pauses between sections.

(Optional) Add background music and sound design to enhance emotion ‚Äî open models like MusicGen or Stable Audio Open can help here.

üîπ My Recommendation for You

If you want the absolute best emotional narration ‚Üí Higgs Audio V2 (cinematic quality, natural storytelling).

If you want flexible, multi-character voices with lower compute needs ‚Üí Chatterbox (zero-shot cloning for multiple narrators).

If you want guided emotion + multilingual support ‚Üí Orpheus.

If you want realism with non-verbal storytelling cues ‚Üí Dia.


### Audio Music/SFX


For background music, Meta‚Äôs MusicGen (3.3B) is state-of-art open text-to-music
reddit.com
. It can generate short audio tracks (e.g. 10‚Äì12‚ÄØs of an ‚Äú80s pop style‚Äù) from text prompts. It‚Äôs open-source (from Facebook AI) and can run locally, but requires ~16‚ÄØGB GPU memory
reddit.com
. There are 4 sizes (up to 3.3B params)
reddit.com
. Other options: diffusion-based music like Riffusion (generates spectrograms), or Google‚Äôs MusicLM community replicas. For sound effects, often it‚Äôs easier to use open sound libraries (e.g. freesound) or simple synthesizers. There are few specialized open SFX generators as of 2025.

Image/Thumbnail Generation: Use text-to-image diffusion models. Stable Diffusion (e.g. v1.5, 2.x, 3.x) is open source (CreativeML RAIL license) and produces photorealistic 2D images from prompts
huggingface.co
. For example, SD v1.5 (released by Stability AI) can generate high-quality 512√ó512 images on a GPU; higher resolutions (768‚Äì1024px) need ~6‚Äì8‚ÄØGB VRAM. A ‚Äúpruned-EMA‚Äù checkpoint is available to reduce VRAM usage
huggingface.co
. Newer variants (SDXL, SD 3.5) improve quality. These models can be run via diffusers or local UIs (Auto1111, ComfyUI). For a thumbnail, simply prompt with scene description or key visual.




Hardware Requirements (GPU/Memory): Hardware needs vary greatly:

LLMs: A quantized 7B model fits in ~8‚Äì12‚ÄØGB RAM
medium.com
. A 13B‚Äì30B LLM needs ~16‚Äì40‚ÄØGB VRAM (or multi-GPU); 70B+ needs 80+‚ÄØGB. CPUs can run small models (e.g. llama.cpp), but inference is slow.

Video models: Heavy. LTXVideo runs on 12‚ÄØGB GPU
hyperstack.cloud
. Wan 1.3B needs ~8.2‚ÄØGB, large Wan 14B or Hunyuan 13B need 40‚Äì80‚ÄØGB to output long, high-res videos
hyperstack.cloud
hyperstack.cloud
. CineScale uses 8√óA100 (each 40‚ÄØGB) for 4K. Expect seconds-per-frame or minutes-per-frame generation.

Voice TTS: Lightweight models (0.5B) use <4‚ÄØGB. HiggsAudio 5.7B may use >16‚ÄØGB. GPU helps for speed; CPU is possible but slower.

MusicGen: Requires ~16‚ÄØGB GPU
reddit.com
.

Image models: SD v1.5 512px ~6‚ÄØGB (with FP16). A 768px image needs ~8‚Äì10‚ÄØGB. High-res (4K) images require tiling or >12‚ÄØGB. Using pruned or 4-bit quantized weights can reduce VRAM (see 
huggingface.co
).

Integration & Posting (n8n): The content and assets can be automated with n8n (itself open-source). n8n can invoke local models (e.g. via Python scripts or HTTP requests) and then use built-in social media nodes. For example, an n8n workflow can take the AI-generated video, title, description and upload them via the YouTube, Instagram, or TikTok APIs. n8n has pre-built nodes/templates for social posting. For instance, one n8n template ‚ÄúAutomating Video Uploads‚Äù shows using a YouTube node to ‚ÄúUpload a video‚Äù
docs.n8n.io
 and simultaneously posting to Instagram/TikTok
n8n.io
. In practice, you‚Äôd use the YouTube node (upload video, set title/description)
docs.n8n.io
 and similar TikTok/Instagram nodes (or an HTTP Request node to call their APIs). n8n handles OAuth/API keys; you just supply the content from the AI steps. This fully automates publishing to social media once content is generated.

**recommendation**

üéµ Best Open-Source Models for Music & SFX
1. MusicGen (Meta)

Model sizes: 300M ‚Üí 3.3B params.

Quality: Currently the best open-source text-to-music. Can generate melodic, emotional soundtracks (ambient, cinematic, electronic, pop).

Inputs: Text prompts like ‚Äúdramatic orchestral build-up with tension, 30s‚Äù.

Hardware:

Small (300M): ~8 GB VRAM

Medium (1.5B): ~12 GB VRAM

Large (3.3B): ~16 GB VRAM (ideal for cinematic audio).

Strengths: Natural compositions, structured like real songs, fits well for background score.

Limitations:

Clip length ~10‚Äì12s (can be looped/stitched).

Doesn‚Äôt handle complex lyrics/vocals well.

‚úÖ Best for emotional background music (hooks, climaxes, ambient tone).

2. Riffusion

Method: Diffusion-based spectrogram ‚Üí audio.

Strengths: Can generate loopable music textures (great for tension, ambient sound, rhythmic effects).

Hardware: Lightweight ‚Äî 6‚Äì8 GB VRAM is fine.

Limitations:

Less structured, more ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù than MusicGen.

Best used for soundscapes, not polished music.

‚úÖ Good for background layers, atmospheres, tension-building.

3. Stable Audio Open (Stability AI)

Focus: Text-to-music/audio, also can generate SFX-like sounds.

Hardware: ~12‚Äì16 GB VRAM.

Strengths: Can do short, detailed audio clips (e.g., ‚Äúsci-fi whoosh,‚Äù ‚Äúcinematic hit‚Äù).

Limitations:

Quality varies compared to curated sound libraries.

Still early in open development.

‚úÖ Use it for transitions, accents, scene-specific effects.

4. Google MusicLM (Community Replicas)

Strengths: Handles longer pieces better than MusicGen.

Hardware: ~12‚Äì16 GB VRAM.

Limitations: Replicas vary in quality; not as polished as MusicGen.

‚úÖ Works if you want longer tracks without stitching.

5. Open SFX Alternatives

Since dedicated SFX generation is still weak in open models:

Use Freesound.org (huge CC-licensed library).

Use HydraSynth / Helm / Surge XT (open-source synthesizers).

Or use Stable Audio Open for procedural effects.

‚úÖ Best approach is hybrid: generate music with MusicGen, then layer SFX from libraries or procedural synths.

üîπ Suggested Workflow for Storytelling

Background music ‚Üí Generate with MusicGen (3.3B for emotion-rich score).

Example prompts:

‚ÄúEpic orchestral build-up, tense strings, cinematic drums, 10s‚Äù

‚ÄúCalm piano with ambient pads, hopeful, 8s‚Äù

Ambient layers ‚Üí Add Riffusion loops (for atmosphere).

SFX hits ‚Üí Use Stable Audio Open (if you want AI-generated whooshes, hits, transitions) + open libraries for realism.

Mixing ‚Üí Align with narration timestamps (from Whisper + TTS).

‚ö° Recommendation for You

Music: MusicGen (3.3B) ‚Üí cinematic & emotional storytelling.

Atmosphere: Riffusion ‚Üí background textures.

SFX: Stable Audio Open + Freesound.org.

That gives you emotional scores, immersive environments, and realistic sound effects ‚Äî all locally, with your GPU.
